# On the Granularity of Data: a Comparison between Classical and Deep Learning approaches for Time Series Forecasting
This repository contains all the supporting material I have used for my final work. Time series analysis is the core of the project, in particular ARIMA, SARIMA and LSTM models are compared across three financial datasets with different granularities.
The structure goes as follows:

üìà DATA
  - NASDAQ 100 Index : minute frequency 
  - AAPL Stock Price : daily frequency 
  - WTI Crude Oil Price : monthly frequency 
  
üíª Prophet Models 
- This folder contains the notebooks of the Prophet model applied to either returns and closing price of AAPL and WTI Crude Oil data.
