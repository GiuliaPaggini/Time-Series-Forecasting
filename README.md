# On the granularity of data: a Comparison between Classical and Deep Learning approaches for Time Series Forecasting
This repository contains all the supporting material I have used for my final work. Time series analysis is the core of the project, in particular ARIMA, SARIMA and LSTM models are compared across three financial datasets with different granularities.
The structure goes as follows:

1)Datasets
  - NASDAQ 100 Index : minute frequency (Source: https://workspace.refinitiv.com/web/Apps/Index/?s=.NDX&st=RIC#/Apps/PriceHistory)
  - AAPL Stock Price : daily frequency (Source: https://it.finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/) 
  - WTI Crude Oil Price : monthly frequency (Source: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DCOILWTICO)
  
2)Final paper Overleaf : https://www.overleaf.com/project/63f61fd58fcc2803bc84841d
